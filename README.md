Welcome! I am Elias Olvera and I am passionate about showcasing my skills in statistics using SPSS and RStudio. 
With my Bachelors of Science in Psychology and a Minor in Biology, I want to employ my background to excel at data analysis and statistical analysis roles. 
As a research assistant in Social Psychology and Cognitive Psychology labs, I have gained hands on experience handling quantitative data and conducting statistical analyses. 
I am seeking opportunities to apply my analytical skills to fields such as psychology, biology, and business. 
Additionally, I am excited about pursuing graduate studies in Quantitative Psychology to further deepen my expertise in statistical methods and their application in psychological research. 
I am eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to data analyst and statistical analyst positions as well as to excel in Quantitative Psychology graduate programs.
