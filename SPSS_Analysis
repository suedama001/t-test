SPSS

Data preparation
Loading the data
To load the data into SPSS I used:
“File” > “Import Data” > “CSV” > “independent_t-test”

Data cleaning
To clean the data I made sure that there were no missing values using:
“Analyze” > “Descriptive Statistics” > “Descriptives”

Summary Statistics
The above instructions also gave me a brief summary of the statistics

Statistical Analysis
T-test
To perform my statistical analysis I performed the following:
“Analyze” > “Compare Means” > “Independent-Samples T test”
Test variable = “Score” and grouping variable = “Group”
Click “Define Groups” and specified that Group 1 = 1, and Group 2 = 2
Click “OK”

Results
My results showed that there is significant difference between the two groups:
t=-6.827
p< .001
95% Confidence Interval of Difference = [-16.145, -8.141]

Conclusion
With these results I reject the null hypothesis and support the alternative hypothesis. There is significant deference between Group 1 and Group 2

Reflection
The benefit of using SPSS is that it has point and click so no code is necessary to perform statistical analyses (although you can use code if you prefer). This makes it a bit easier to use for people who are not so familiar with code.
