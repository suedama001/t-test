RStudio Cloud

Data Preparation
Loading the data
First I uploaded my data into RStudio Cloud.
Using the following code I installed and loaded my data:

install.packages(“readr”)
library(readr)
ttest <- read_csv(“independent_t-test.csv”)
head(ttest)

Data Cleaning
I used str() and summary() to see the structure of my data and to check for any missing values.
Then I had to make sure that my Group was a factor so the data analysis could be preformed.
This was the code I used:
str(ttest)
summary(ttest)
ttest$Group <- as.factor(ttest$Group)

Exploratory Data Analysis
Summary Statistics
Using summary() I can see a summary of the data including the minimum, median, mean, max, and the number of groups and subjects in groups

Visualizations
I decided to make a box plot, histogram, and density plot for my visualizations using ggplot()
This was the code needed:
install.packages(“ggplot2)
library(readr)

Box plot:
ggplot(data = data_frame, aes(x = group, y = value, fill = group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Two Groups",
       x = "Group",
       y = "Value")

Histogram:
ggplot(data = data_frame, aes(x = value, fill = group)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.6, position = "identity", bins = 20) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Two Groups", 
       x = "Value",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()

Density plot: 
ggplot(data = data_frame, aes(x = value, fill = group, color = group)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.4) +
  labs(title = "Density Plot of Two Groups",
       x = "Value",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal()

Statistical Analysis
T-test
T-test are performed to analyze the difference of means between two groups
This is the code that was used to perform and display the t-test results:

t_test_result <- t.test(Score ~ Group, data = ttest)
t_test_result

This is what I got back:

Welch Two Sample t-test

data:  Score by Group
t = -6.8274, df = 9.3259, p-value = 6.453e-05
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 1 and group 2 is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -16.14490  -8.14081
sample estimates:
mean in group 1 mean in group 2 
       13.85714        26.00000 

Results
To present the results of the t-test I used the following code:
t_test_result$p.value
t_test_result$conf.int

These were the results:
> t_test_result$p.value
[1] 6.453493e-05
> t_test_result$conf.int
[1] -16.14490  -8.14081
attr(,"conf.level")
[1] 0.95

There was a significant difference between the scores of Group 1 and Group 2. (t = -6.8274, p<0.001). 
The 95% confidence interval for the difference in means was [-16.14, -8.14], suggesting that the true mean difference is likely between -16.14 and -8.14 suggesting that the scores for Group 2 are significantly higher than Group 1’s.

Conclusion
With these results, I confirm what I obtained from SPSS
I reject the null hypothesis and support the alternative hypothesis that Group 1 and Group 2 have significant difference.

Reflection
Through this project I learned how to perform a t-test on RStudio Cloud. This included how to:
Upload data
Clean data
Make visualizations
Perform t-test
Interpret my results
The advantages of using RStudio Cloud are: 
You can easily obtain graphs as long as you know the code.
 It is very detailed on the information that it gives you.
A challenge that I faced were:
Learning the syntax for the codes
making sure that the data was in the correct format.
In the future my goals are:
To perform a t-test using a bigger data set collected from a real world setting.
To perform more advanced types of statistical analysis.
